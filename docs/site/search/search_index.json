SAWPS is a Global Environment Facility (GEF)-funded project. SAWPS is a coordinated system of wildlife trade monitoring with centralised/shared information for priority species (rhino, lion, leopard, cheetah, and elephant). The system will eventually be able to house information for other species as well. Currently, permits for legal trade, information about illegal trade seizures, and other law enforcement processes, and provincial-level monitoring data for key species (e.g., population counts and population information such as births, deaths, translocations, etc.) are captured at a provincial and sometimes national level. In addition, private wildlife owners maintain their own information systems about wildlife on their land, and some non-governmental organisations maintain their own information systems for specific species, SAWPS is expected to provide valuable data and information on a national level about the impacts of legal and illegal trade in the species and the current status of the distribution and abundance of the species. The data will then be interrogated and analysed by users of the system to inform national and international permitting and listing or reporting processes (e.g., the Threatened or Protected Species list under NEMBA, the CITES listings, hunting quotas, etc.).</p> <p>The aim of SAWPS is to have a system for centralised population-level monitoring of traded wildlife where information from provinces and private landowners is made available to key users (primarily to the Scientific Authority and other relevant decision makers) under strict access and security controls.</p>"},{"location":"about/#sanbi-the-scientific-authority","title":"SANBI the Scientific authority","text":"<p>SANBI is the body mandated by the National Environmental Management Biodiversity Act of 2004 (No. 10 of 2004) to champion the exploration, conservation, sustainable use, appreciation, and enjoyment of South Africa\u2019s exceptionally rich biodiversity for all South Africans. This includes giving effect to international agreements, and cooperative governance arrangements directed at ensuring the country\u2019s rich and varied biodiversity is conserved for future generations. SANBI also manages the technical unit for the Scientific Authority of South Africa (SAoSA).</p> <p>The SANBI technical unit, which provides advice and analysis on various species, recognises that is consumes a significant amount of its time and effort trying to obtain data from a variety of sector stakeholders \u2013 which could be better spent on more strategic, value-adding activities, and that it would be more efficient if they could access the required data from a central location. This has led SANBI to initiate the SAWPS project to develop a national digital platform for population-level monitoring of traded wildlife as part of its responsibility for Component 1 of the Global Environmental Facility-funded project titled \u2018Strengthening institutions, information management and monitoring to reduce the rate of illegal wildlife trade in South Africa\u2019 The focus of the project is therefore on monitoring population levels for charismatic species such as the lion, elephant, leopard, and rhino. The system is designed with scalability in mind such that alter iterations will be able to cater for data pertaining to other fauna and flora species as and when these become required.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"about/#overview-to-the-sawps-platform-functionality","title":"Overview to the SAWPS platform functionality","text":""},{"location":"developer/narrative/","title":"Narrative","text":""},{"location":"developer/narrative/#setting-up-a-dev-env","title":"Setting up a dev env","text":"<p>Please follow the Kartoza coding standards.</p>"},{"location":"developer/narrative/#getting-source-code","title":"\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Getting source code","text":"<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/kartoza/sawps.git\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"developer/narrative/#how-to-run-project-with-visual-studio-code","title":"\ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f How To Run Project with Visual Studio Code","text":"<p>Copy and customize environnment file: Create a copy of the <code>deployment/.template.env</code> file and name it <code>deployment/.env</code>.
