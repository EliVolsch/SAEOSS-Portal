## Re-building containers

**Containers need to be rebuilt if changes have been made in `SAEOSS-Portal/pyproject.toml` or if a new sql migration has been added in `ckanext/saeoss/migration`**

1. Cd into `SAEOSS-Portal/docker`
2. Run `./compose.py --compose-file docker-compose.yml --compose-file docker-compose.dev.yml down`
3. Run `./build.sh`
4. Run `./compose.py --compose-file docker-compose.yml --compose-file docker-compose.dev.yml up`
5. Run `docker exec -it saeoss_ckan-web_1 poetry run ckan search-index rebuild`

## Restarting saeoss_ckan-web_1

**Container needs to be restarted if a new template file is added to override ckan defaults for the change to reflect**

1. Open up a terminal
2. Run `docker restart saeoss_ckan-web_1`

## Common errors in containers

### Datasets have dissapeared from the search page

Solr index needs be rebuilt

**Steps to fix**

1. Open up a terminal
2. Run `docker exec -it saeoss_ckan-web_1 poetry run ckan search-index rebuild`

### SQL Rollback error

When you encounter the following error `Canâ€™t reconnect until invalid transaction is rolled back. Please rollback() fully before proceeding`:

1. Open up a terminal
2. Run `docker stop saeoss_ckan-web_1`
3. Run `docker stop saeoss_ckan-db_1`
4. Run `docker start saeoss_ckan-web_1`
5. Run `docker start saeoss_ckan-db_1`

### There is no data in pycsw

1. Connect to the database hosted in container `saeoss_ckan-db_1`
2. Check if there is a MATERIALIZED VIEW created for pycsw
3. If there is no MATERIALIZED VIEW, run the following sql script (script location can also be found at `ckanext/saeoss/templates/pycsw/pycsw_view.sql`)
```
