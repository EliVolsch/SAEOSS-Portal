## Overview

This section gives an overview of the number of records on the platform, records returned with the search and indicates if the user is utilising a [Saved Search](./saved-search.md)

![Metadata Overview ](./img/metadata-overview-1.png){: style="height:200px"}

1. **Total number of metadata records:** This is the count of all of the metadata records on the platform.
2. **Records Returned:** This displays how many records are returned following the user's search criteria.
3. **Saved Search:** The flag indicates if a saved search is being utilised. If the flag is hollow (![Metadata Overview 2](./img/metadata-overview-2.png){: style="height:15px"}) the search has not been saved and if the flag is filled (![Metadata Overview 3](./img/metadata-overview-3.png){: style="height:15px"}) then a saved search is being utilised.

The filters allow users to refine the list of records that they can see to meet their criteria.
