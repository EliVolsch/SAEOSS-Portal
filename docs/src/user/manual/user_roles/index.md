# User roles

Access to data and functionalities on the SAEOSS-Portal platform is governed by user roles and permissions. User roles define a default set of permissions generally assigned to different types of users and linked to their profiles. When a new user profile is registered, it is automatically assigned to the general user role.

Individual permissions can be set by the administrator for user profiles to provide additional access to data or functionalities if required. This means that even though a user profile is assigned to the general user role, it can have access to functionalities or permissions typically reserved for admin users. Additional user roles can also be created, or default user role permissions can be changed by an administrator with the relevant access.


### Five types of users

### 1. Anonymous user
This user has search and viewing and downloading capabilities of public metadata records. This user role is not required to register, nor are they a member of any organisation.

### 2. Registered user


### Editor
This user role is a privileged user, who is part of a known institution or company. They must register on the SAEOSS Portal and provide additional information about their affiliation. This role is a member of an organisation that has permission to create (but not publicly publish), edit and delete metadata records on the portal in the organisations where they are a member.
