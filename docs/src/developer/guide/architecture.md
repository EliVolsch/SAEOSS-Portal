# System Architecture

In this section, we outline the system architecture using ER Diagrams, Software Component Diagrams etc. and key libraries / frameworks used in this project.

## Software Components Used

The following is a list, with brief descriptions, of the key components used in creating this platform. Please refer to their individual documentation for in-depth technical information. ckan, postgres, docker, pycsw and harvester plugins

| Logo | Name | Notes |
|------------|---------|----------------|
|![CKAN](img/ckan.png){: style="height:30px"} | [CKAN](https://ckan.org/) | CKAN is an open-source DMS (data management system) for powering data hubs and data portals. CKAN makes it easy to publish, share and use data.|
|![pycsw](img/pycsw.png){: style="height:30px"} | [Pycsw](https://pycsw.org/) | pycsw allows for the publishing and discovery of geospatial metadata via numerous APIs (CSW 2/CSW 3, OpenSearch, OAI-PMH, SRU), providing a standards-based metadata and catalogue component of spatial data infrastructures.|
| ![Docker](img/architecture-docker.svg){: style="height:30px"}  |  [Docker](https://docker.com) | Accelerate how you build, share, and run applications. Docker helps developers build, share, and run applications anywhere â€” without tedious environment configuration or management. |
| ![ckanext-harvest](img/ckan.png){: style="height:30px"}  | [Ckanext-harvest](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-harvest) | Remote harvesting extension for CKAN. |


## CKAN Components
<!-- 
The following diagram represents the docker containers, ports and volumes that are used to compose this platform.

![](img/architecture-docker-diagram.png)


The docker volumes are used for the following purposes, with the following typical storage allocations:

NAME | CAPACITY | ACCESS | MODES | NOTES
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
media-data | 10Gi | RWX | azurefile | Used for the uploaded files, example for XLS of file of importer. Azurefile and size is sufficient, mostly these files are not big.
redis-data | 10Gi | RWX | azurefile | Used by redis for database backup (to make queue persistence when redis rerun).
static-data | 10Gi | RWX | azurefile | Used for the static files.
 -->

## Data Model
